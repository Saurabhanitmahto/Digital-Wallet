This project is a backend implementation of a Digital Wallet System built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It enables users to securely register and log in using JWT authentication, manage their wallet by depositing, withdrawing, and transferring money, and view transaction history. All user passwords are encrypted using bcrypt to ensure security. The system also includes basic fraud detection by monitoring rapid transactions and flagging suspicious activity. Admin-level routes provide useful analytics such as total balances, flagged transactions, and top users. A Postman collection is included for easy testing of all API endpoints. This project demonstrates core backend development skills including authentication, route protection, database operations, middleware usage, and modular project structuring.
